            <p>The most important part is the CPU or Central Processing Unit, also called the "brain" of the computer. This is what will determine how many inputs and outputs can be processed in a certain amount of time. The better the CPU, the faster the computer and without it the computer will not be able to operate. It is also responsible for the communication between all of the other components.</p>
